# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System built using Python. The system utilizes cosine similarity and vectorization techniques to recommend movies based on user input.

## Features

- Recommends movies based on cosine similarity.
- Uses vectorization for efficient computation.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhawneet1/Movie_Recommendation.git
   cd Movie_Recommendation
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
